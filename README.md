# JustAnotherBanPlugin

JustAnotherBanPlugin is you guessed it, a ban plugin. It's for 1.13+ Spigot/Paper minecraft. I aim for it to be fully GUI based. To start with, it will just intagrate with an existing plugin (I'm using AdvancedBan) and turn it GUI based, but I do have future plans to make it handle all the banning itself.

## To Do List

- [ ] DataHandler (Saving data for later access)
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Make GUI configurable
- [ ] Detection of potential alts
- [ ] Add banning/kicked without a need for another plugin
